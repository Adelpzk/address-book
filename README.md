# AdressBook

# Address Book Application

Welcome to my Address Book project! I designed this application with various features and functionalities, keeping simplicity and efficiency in mind. Here's a glimpse of what my app offers and the journey I undertook to bring this project to life!

## Live Application

I'm excited to share the live version of my project, hosted on Vercel. You can access it anytime, anywhere at [address-book-dun.vercel.app](https://address-book-dun.vercel.app).

## Local Development

### Getting Started

Setting up the environment for local development is straightforward. Here’s how you can start:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `ng serve` or `npm start` to start the dev server.

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). One feature you’ll love is hot-reloading—your changes will automatically reflect live!

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in the project directory:

Run ng test or npm test


## Project Overview

### Approach

I approached this project with a clear roadmap in mind, divided into several phases—design, development, testing, and deployment. This structured methodology ensured thoroughness and consistency throughout the creation process.

### Features

I built an application with a user-friendly interface consisting of three main pages:

- **Home:** Your journey begins here.
- **Contacts:** Here, you’ll find a comprehensive list of users fetched from the API. You’ll love the pagination feature and being able to choose the number of entries displayed. Want more details on a contact? Each user card opens into a dialog containing more information and the option to 'favorite' the contact!
- **Favourites:** This special place is reserved for your most important contacts.

### Technical Implementation

I adopted several strategies to ensure enhanced performance and user experience:

- **Efficient Data Handling:** I implemented caching mechanisms for API results, so when you revisit pages, it’s faster—no need to wait for repeated requests.
- **Optimized Media Loading:** All images employ lazy loading, ensuring a smooth, delay-free rendering.
- **Dynamic Favorites:** I dedicated a service for managing the favorites list, allowing for real-time updates when adding or removing contacts.

## Future Implementations:


- **Enhanced Search:** introduce a search and filter functionality to effortlessly locate contacts.
- **User Authentication:**  implementing a secure authentication system to protect user data.
- **Expanded Testing:**  increase test coverage to ensure flawless performance.
